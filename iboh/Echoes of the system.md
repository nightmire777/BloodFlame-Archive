in the feedback page, it shows whatever feedback i type along with a returrn code (127)
when running echo, it returns a different code (0)
these should be system return codes, 

with the assumption of it being executed on linux , i ran ls

since the system prohibits characters like $ < > ;  (i forgot to ss)
it also prohibits wrods like cat which i was plan to use 
therefore a substituition of cat would be either head or tail which alow you to view part of the file

and done!
